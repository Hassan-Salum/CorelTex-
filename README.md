CorelTex is an infrastructure company building the **Sovereign Memory Layer for Artificial Intelligence**.

We design systems that give AI agents persistent, verifiable, and portable memory — independent of any single model provider or platform.

## What CorelTex Is Building

CorelTex focuses on **AI memory, identity, and trust infrastructure**, including:

- **Sovereign Memory Protocol**  
  Long-term AI memory owned by the user, not the model provider.

- **HybridRAG Architecture**  
  Combining Knowledge Graphs (structure, logic, provenance) with Vector Retrieval (speed and semantic similarity).

- **Continuum Memory Systems**  
  Memory that evolves over time: retention, decay, consolidation, and mutation.

- **Identity & Provenance Layer**  
  Cryptographic signing of memories and agent actions using decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

## Why CorelTex Exists

Modern AI systems suffer from three structural failures:

1. **Amnesiac Intelligence**  
   Context disappears after each session.

2. **Black-Box Memory**  
   No way to verify where answers come from.

3. **Vendor Lock-In**  
   Memory owned by centralized platforms, not users.

CorelTex exists to solve these problems at the infrastructure level.

## Core Principles

- **Sovereignty**  
  Memory belongs to the user or organization.

- **Provenance**  
  Every answer must be traceable to its source.

- **Persistence**  
  Intelligence without memory is not intelligence.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Enterprise AI agents  
- Safety-critical systems  
- Regulated industries (health, finance, infrastructure)  
- On-premise and sovereign AI deployments

---

## Project Status

🟡 Early-stage architecture and prototyping  
This repository contains foundational concepts, documentation, and early implementations.

---

## Philosophy

CorelTex is not a consumer product.  
It is infrastructure.

Built for systems where **trust, accountability, and memory** matter.
